## Security Features

NymQuest incorporates several security mechanisms to protect your gameplay experience:

- **Message Authentication**: All communications are authenticated using HMAC-SHA256, preventing message tampering
- **Message Expiration**: Messages automatically expire after a set time period (varies by message type), preventing delayed replay attacks
- **Replay Protection**: A sliding window approach prevents message replay attacks within the active time window

- Use emotes for non-verbal communication when privacy is a priority
- Don't stand too close to other players if you want to avoid combat
- Use the help command if you forget any commands
- Watch the message log for important game events and announcements
