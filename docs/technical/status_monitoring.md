# Status Monitoring System

The NymQuest client includes a comprehensive status monitoring system that provides real-time visibility into connection health and privacy status while maintaining anonymity.

## Core Components

- **StatusMonitor Module**: Centralized tracking of connection metrics, message delivery, and privacy indicators
- **Network Integration**: Deep integration with the NetworkManager to monitor all mixnet communications
- **Thread-Safe Architecture**: Uses `Arc<Mutex<StatusMonitor>>` for safe concurrent access across network and UI threads
- **Privacy-Compliant Metrics**: All collected data respects privacy principles and doesn't compromise user anonymity

## Real-Time Tracking

### Message Lifecycle Monitoring
- **End-to-End Tracking**: Follows messages from send → in-transit → delivered/failed
- **Latency Measurement**: Precise timing of message delivery paths
- **Success Rate Calculation**: Tracks percentage of successfully delivered messages
- **Error Analysis**: Categorizes and quantifies delivery failures

### Connection Health Assessment
- **Quality Indicators**: Evaluates mixnet connection quality based on response times and success rates
- **Status Levels**: Connection health is classified as:
  - **Excellent**: High success rate, low latency
  - **Good**: Above average success rate and acceptable latency
  - **Fair**: Average performance with occasional issues
  - **Poor**: Below average performance with frequent issues
  - **Critical**: Significant connection problems requiring attention

### Privacy Protection Monitoring
- **Anonymity Status**: Tracks current privacy protection level
- **Status Classification**:
  - **Fully Protected**: Optimal privacy conditions
  - **Protected**: Standard privacy protection
  - **Degraded**: Some privacy concerns detected
  - **Compromised**: Significant privacy risks identified

### Network Statistics
- **Rolling Averages**: Calculates moving averages for key metrics:
  - Average latency
  - Packet loss rates
  - Delivery success rates
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies patterns and changes in connection quality

### Anonymity Set Awareness
- **Set Size Estimation**: Displays approximate anonymity set size
- **Privacy Context**: Provides context for understanding current privacy level

## User Interface Integration

### Status Dashboard
- **Real-Time Display**: Continuously updated status information
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded indicators for quick assessment:
  - Green: Excellent/Fully Protected
  - Blue: Good/Protected
  - Yellow: Fair/Degraded
  - Red: Poor/Critical/Compromised

### Data Freshness Indicators
- **Timestamp Display**: Shows when metrics were last updated
- **Thresholds**: Appropriate time thresholds accounting for mixnet delays

### Non-Intrusive Design
- **Sidebar Integration**: Status information displayed in side panel
- **Minimalist Indicators**: Simple icons and colors for essential status
- **Expandable Details**: Detailed metrics available on demand

## Implementation Details

The monitoring system:
- Updates metrics in real-time as messages are sent and received
- Calculates rolling averages over configurable time windows
- Applies appropriate thresholds for status classification
- Synchronizes status data across UI and network threads
- Gracefully handles edge cases and disconnections

This comprehensive monitoring system enhances user awareness of both connection health and privacy status while preserving the core privacy guarantees of the Nym mixnet.
